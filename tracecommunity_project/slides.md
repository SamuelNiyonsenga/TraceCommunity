Slide 2 — Problem
- Small cooperatives lack trustworthy provenance
- Disputes over origin and quality reduce income
- Consumers and regulators lack easy verification tools

Slide 3 — Solution
- Immutable batch records on blockchain + IPFS evidence
- Role-based checkpoints (Producer → Transporter → Inspector → Market)
- QR verification pages for consumers

Slide 4 — How it works
1. Producer creates batch with metadata + IPFS evidence
2. Transporter adds collection checkpoint
3. Inspector records quality test
4. Market/Buyer verifies via QR/public page

Slide 5 — Demo
- Show React verification page & QR scan
- Show checkpoint creation via MetaMask (change account)

Slide 6 — Impact & Metrics
- Increase trust and price transparency
- Reduce disputes and payment delays
- Enable fairer pricing for cooperatives

Slide 7 — Roadmap
- Permissioned consortium deployment
- Mobile app for offline capture & sync
- Reputation system & micro-payments

Slide 8 — Ask
